# Fictional E-commerce | 100 Days of Code Challenge 🚀

## 📖 About the Project

This is a fictitious e-commerce project created as part of the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge, focusing on learning and evolving front-end development skills. The goal is to develop a modern and functional website, close to the standard of a professional e-commerce platform, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually React. The project also serves as a portfolio to showcase my web development skills.

The system consumes dynamic data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/?spm=5aebb161.2ef5001f.0.0.14b0c921nnPvyQ) to simulate products, allowing the display of items with prices, descriptions, and categories. Additionally, it implements features such as a simulated shopping cart, filters by category and price, and responsiveness for different devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

So far, the technologies and tools used in the project are:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure of the site.
- **CSS3**: Design and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactive logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Fake Store API**: Simulated dynamic products.
- **localStorage**: Temporary storage of shopping cart data.

As I progress in the challenge, new technologies and libraries/frameworks will be integrated, such as:

- **React**: For a more robust and modular architecture.
- **Automation tools**: Webpack or Vite for optimization and build processes.

## 📈 Challenge Progress

**Completed Features**

- [x] Basic HTML structure.
- [x] Initial design with CSS.
- [x] Basic logic with JavaScript.
- [x] Consumption of Fake Store API to display dynamic products.
- [x] Search system by name and category.

## ✨ Current Features

The project already includes the following features:

1. **Dynamic Product Display:**

- Products are dynamically loaded from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/?spm=5aebb161.2ef5001f.0.0.14b0c921nnPvyQ).
- Each product includes a title, image, price, category, and description.

2. **Simulated Shopping Cart:**

- Implemented with `localStorage` to store selected products.
- Features to add/remove products and adjust quantities.

3. **Search System:**

- Allows searching for products by name or category.

4. **Filters:**

- Filtering by category (e.g., men's clothing, women's clothing, jewelry, electronics).
- Filtering by price (e.g., products above $100).

5. **Product Details Modal:**

- Displays the full description of the product when clicking the "Details" button.

6. **Responsiveness:**

- Layout adapts to tablets and mobile devices.
